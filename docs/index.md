# Welcome to My Brain
## Just a few notes
On this site you can find a few commands which helps me to do my daily work and hobby.
Sometimes I forget the correct syntax to a command **looking at you symlink!** and need to fastly search through my notes.
Maybe this site can help you to find a command to fix your problem, the site is mostly optimized for my private use.

## Using the search
Press **F** to use the search without clicking on it and look for a command or text pattern you're searching.
For example use **mdadm** to look for managing linux software raid.
Hopefully most sites are tagged.
